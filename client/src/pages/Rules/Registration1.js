      <p><b>Can I register my team early if I have everything completed and so I do not have to attend registration on Friday night?</b></p>
      <p>There is no Friday Night Registration. All materials must be submitted via email to the appropriate email as per the registration instructions sent out at the time of acceptance.</p>
      <p><b>Can we substitute the Liability/Release form with a generic one?</b></p>
      <p>NO!! You must use the liability release supplied with the acceptance packet.</p>
      <p><b>Do I need to fill out of the Hotel Form if I am not staying in a hotel?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, all teams MUST fill out "Information/Hotel" form (even if you do not use a Hotel) and turn in this form. The form contains contact information the tournament may need to use during the tournament. If you do NOT use a hotel indicate a "zero" on the "Information/Hotel" form!</p>
      <p><b>Does each team need a medical release form for ALL the players?</b></p>
      <p>While the tournament does not require that teams have a medical release form for each player, we highly recommend that they do have them for each player and bring them along. The tournament does NOT check these.</p>
      <p><b>I need to get duplicate forms and I have already confirmed. How to I do that?</b></p>
      <p>You will need your TEAM ID NUMBER (Like WSC123456789 you received with your Acceptance Form) to access the forms. When you log in, the system will tell you that your team has already been confirmed. There will be a link to the page that contains the duplicate forms.</p>
      <p><b>My team belongs to US Club Soccer and they do not require a travel permit. Should I notify anyone?</b></p>
      <p>Yes. Send the tournament an email through this web site and inform them that you are registered under US Club Soccer. The tournament is aware of this rule. Please include the name of your team, the age group and your assigned WSC number.</p>
      <p><b>What do I need for registration?</b></p>
      <p>If registering under USYS, you will need to provide the following:
        1. Completed Hotel Form for ALL TEAMS
        2. Original State Approved Roster and one copy of that roster to leave with the tournament
