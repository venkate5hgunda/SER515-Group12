          <p><b>When I apply online and I use Pay Pal for payment do I have to mail in a copy of my application?</b></p>
          <p>No. When you follow this procedure, the tournament will automatically receive a copy of your application and payment.</p>
          <p><b>Where can I find the Forms page?</b></p>
          <p>Once accepted
              1. Go to www.warriorclassic.com and click on the word FORMS at the top of the page and enter your assigned wsc
              number in the box requested.

              2. The next screen is your teams Application Status page and then click on Get Duplication Forms

              3. Select and print the forms you need.</p>
          <p><b>Which field is XX division playing on?</b></p>
          <p>We do not have designated complexes/fields for each division level. The fields are determined after we accept the teams, based on the number of teams per division and the available fields. Each venue has both small-sided and full-sized fields. If you are planning your hotel rooms based on your teams playing field, you should be aware that the fields are located centrally in the Greater Dayton area and most hotels are no more than 15-30 minutes away from any one venue. You should also be aware that hotels will fill up quickly as we host over 500 teams at the Classic and booking early is perhaps far more important than booking a hotel close to the fields.</p>
