   <p><b>Do you want to check on the status of your team?</b></p>
   <p>Log in using your assigned team Id number (Example: WSC123456789) that was assigned to you when you registered. Go to the login box under the Coaches tab in the left rail.</p>
   <p><b>How do I place my team in one division or the other?</b></p>
   <p>Ultimately, your team will be placed in the division to be the most competitive with other teams that apply. However, you may help the selection committee by indicating your choice on the application form. GOLD is the UPPER Division and RED is the MIDDLE Division and WHITE is LOWER Division. We reserve the right to combine levels if Necessary.</p>
   <p><b>When do I send travel permit?</b></p>
   <p>This is only required when/if your team is accepted. Travel permits are REQUIRED for all teams who are registered outside Ohio South(OSYSA) except for US Club Soccer that does not require travel permits. You should include it in the registration email you submit.</p>
