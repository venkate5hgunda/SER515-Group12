          <p><b>I am a local team who does not require housing. Do I still need to book hotel rooms to be in the tournament?</b></p>
          <p>No. Only the teams who require housing during their participation in the tournament, must use the hotels that are listed on the www.warriorclassic.com web site (SEE HOTEL tab at top of website) as part of their acceptance.
              In addition, ALL TEAMS (including teams NOT using hotels) will be asked to fill out a "Information/Hotel" form (showing the number of rooms being booked or not used) verifying where they are staying for the event or are a local team.</p>
          <p><b>Need assistance booking a hotel room for the Warrior Classic?</b></p>
          <p>Go to the HOTEL tab at the top of the website.</p>
          <p><b>Our team needs a hotel. Can you help us with that?</b></p>
          <p>Yes! Because the Warrior Classic is a "Stay to Play" tournament, those teams requiring hotel accommodations need to book through "Site Search" housing bureau. They will assist you in acquiring accommodations suitable for you. Go to "Hotels" tab at the top of the website.</p>
